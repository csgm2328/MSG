8월 19일","Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a merry band of brewers. Legend has it, every order placed bestows magical bev making powers upon Sław & the other brewery elves.
Order now for W/E delivery & we'll all live happily ever after.
THE END.

After all we’re quite similar, you and I. In fact, leaving aside that I’m not a singer, songwriter, frontman of one of the greatest bands of all time, airline pilot, fencer, brewer and radio and tv host, I am a writer too.
