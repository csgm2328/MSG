We simply don’t know enough about it or its reproduction rate to be labelling it a “doomsday” variant.

A new “doomsday” Covid variant has been discovered, with health experts fearing it moves nearly “twice as fast” as the deadly Delta strain.

Also: Rossi nearly transferred to Club Brugge in a few weeks ago for around $8-10m, but the deal fell through.
