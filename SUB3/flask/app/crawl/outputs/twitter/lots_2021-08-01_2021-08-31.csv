I’m so used to blind people saying they thought I was white, it doesn’t surprise me now. When you do image descriptions, don’t skip race. Don’t leave room for harmful assumptions. This is #intersectionality. I made a video on inclusive descriptions

@harveystahoe
should open their parking lots up for evacuees who can't get out. 

Many businesses told employees they couldn't evacuate a few days ago or they would be fired, are now stuck.
