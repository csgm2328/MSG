8월 31일","Still in the air as to what has really happened, I ask 
@matt_kohrs
 with no animosity and no accusations, to have a conversation in private so that we can reach an amends. I hate that there’s been drama resultant of the confusion.

Please, do not send hate to him or his following.

And a big screw you to Matt Kohrs for supposedly not watching @ThatGuyAstro's cycle theory videos when I dm'ed him that he should check them out & then on his stream saying today he didn't know anything about Astro but in the same stream said he ""noticed a repeating pattern"".  twitter.com/cheeto_shane/s…
