8월 30일","I’m wearing my first-day-of-school dress. It has just one coffee stain I discovered as I drove to work this morning. I think it’s probably the coffee from the fall of 2017, the last time I taught secondary school. In elementary, I need pants for the first day.

“… strong men! Men! Where are you? Men! Wake up—smell the coffee. Let’s go. Make men men again. Make men men again. Let’s go. Men! When we walk into those school boards we’re going to have everything we need …”

PA GOP Gov candidate Steve Lynch today: “Forget going into these school boards with freaking data. You go in to these school boards to remove them. I’m going in with 20 strong men and I’m gonna give them an option - they can leave or they can be removed.”

8월 30일","The verdict is in... I will not be using this mug for coffee again. It didn't keep the coffee hot, and it felt weird having to press a button each time I took a sip. Perhaps it'll be better for cold drinks.

8월 30일","So! There's a lovely DeLonghi coffee machine where I'm staying that uses the pod. Coffee tastes fine, is hot and makes me feel good.

It turns out I've been putting used coffee pods in the coffee machine for a week and a half without realising it.
