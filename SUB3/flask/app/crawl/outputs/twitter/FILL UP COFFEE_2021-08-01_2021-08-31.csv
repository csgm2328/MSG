How do u take

“Please fill it up with

Fun fact: I don't care!

For me, it's:

1. Writing something pretty. 
2. Reading something pretty. 
3. Drinking coffee. 
4. Working up a sweat. 
5. Loving on June (my pup).
6. Loving on my girl.
7. Loving on my people.

Sykes already on a suspended prison sentence when he kicked a cop in the face so hard she felt a 'clicking' in her jaw, feared it had been broken and suffered severe bruising.

I’m ready for a drink because my bar area was finally finished today. This space was previously a closet with shelves closed in by old wood bifold doors. Before pic in the reply.
