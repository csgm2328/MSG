From the coast, it may appear a deep blue on a sunny day. Or gray when it’s stormy. However, the blue hue is created by water itself! Learn more about the ocean and its colors. #MondayLearning
Why is the ocean blue? - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
One idea is that it reflects the sky. But if we sink below the surface, the blue color remains. Here, the water isn’t reflecting the sky. So why is the ocean blue?
