8월 13일","Friday night #fiano - 2015 Feudi di San Gregorio - DOCG Fiano di Avellino - bright floral aromas, ripe stone fruit and pear on the palate. At 13.5% abv this is a weighty white, but it’s nicely balanced by good acidity and minerality. Good value at $35 a bottle.

 Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. { 2 Cor:13:5}
Let a person examine himself. { 1 Cor:11:28}
 Let each person examine his own work. { Gal:6:4}
