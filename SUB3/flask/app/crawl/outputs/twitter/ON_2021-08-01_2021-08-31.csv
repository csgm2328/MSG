""Climate change is an everything issue,"" 
@KHayhoe
 told me. ""To advocate for climate action, we only have to be one thing — a human living on planet Earth.""
Climate change is making hurricanes stronger, slower and wetter. Ida checked all the boxes
Hurricane Ida was a prime example of how scientists say climate change is making storms worse.
