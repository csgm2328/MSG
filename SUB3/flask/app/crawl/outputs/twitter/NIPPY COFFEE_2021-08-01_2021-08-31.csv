Enjoy if you're over achieving today - or just catching your breathe. It's bank holiday August

I've given up tobacco many times before (Once a smoker always a smoker ). Don't drink for long periods but crave the sour/bitter/nippy flaours. Tea,coffee & water are just too boring.
But give up real bacon & cheese 
Never.",🙄 😱,,,,[],https://twitter.com/ThirlDad/status/1428824323368833031
