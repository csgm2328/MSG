On 14th December 2019, I used my ATM card at Iyana Ipaja using Access Bank AMT to withdraw 10k and it was successful. Later in the night, I used the same card at Oniru to withdraw another 10k...

, a decisão é isolada e há súmula do STJ em sentido contrário (súm. 567). Acrescento eu: e decisão é contrária à letra do CP (art. 17), que exige impropriedade - absoluta - do objeto ou ineficácia - absoluta - do meio

Réu escondeu produtos nos bolsos. Funcionários do supermercado exerceram vigilância, acompanhando todo o iter criminis. Abordagem com devolução dos produtos. Crime impossível pela absoluta ineficácia do meio.
