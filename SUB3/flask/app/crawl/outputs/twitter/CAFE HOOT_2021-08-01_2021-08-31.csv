@US_FDA
 turns around & chides the vaccine hesitant, thereby neutralizing any positive impact?

It’s unprofessional & it’s gross.

What’s your endgame 
@US_FDA
? A hoot in the cafe or the saving of millions through vaccination? 1/2

The @nytimes title is shocking & guarantees a click.

The @US_FDA tweet is funny & guarantees a scoff.

Neither is helpful; both are disingenuous hackery & guaranteed to antagonize precisely those Americans who still need convincing to be vaccinated.
