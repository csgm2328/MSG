Looks for the CSU offense to use a lot of 12 personnel this fall with Cam Butler & Trey McBride back at TE. 

Addazio mentioned defenses want to run nickel & dime. It’s a good way for the Rams to take advantage of their strengths & counter.

At the Dodi's apartment, his butler Rene Delorm lays out some clothes - a brown suede jacket, blue jeans, a checked shirt and cowboy style boots.

He is getting ready to go to dinner with Diana.

It is 9pm in Paris.
