It is based on thermoplastic polyolefin and is synthesized with non-toxic flame retardants and additives, so its temperature resistance is much better than some ordinary logo tubes.",,,,,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9ItE3LVkAEDm1P?format=jpg&name=small'],https://twitter.com/DengMors/status/1428253601575493636

8월 22일","Since growing coconuts often experience temperatures around 100 degrees F.., ordinary room temperature isn't an oxidative challenge. Fish oil or safflower oil, though, can't be stored long at room
temperature, and at 98 degrees F, the spontaneous oxidation is very fast. Ray Peat

8월 24일","FAILED!

I wasn't able to germinate these seeds successfully cuz I'm such an idiot - I totally forgot about the temperature of the medium + more (I put my basin indoor - big mistake).  
I should have used ordinary soil instead of the potting mix. 
It's like throwing cash

Finally arrived. 
Paano kaya to mapa-germinate?

This one is on the upper echelon of Philippine timber species in terms of strength and durability (way superior than Narra, Molave, Tindalo)
