PA GOP Gov candidate Steve Lynch today: “Forget going into these school boards with freaking data. You go in to these school boards to remove them. I’m going in with 20 strong men and I’m gonna give them an option - they can leave or they can be removed.”

8월 31일","My review of ""He's All That"": It's exactly what you'd expect. So, as long as you keep that in mind and you're really high, there's an okay chance you may find yourself charmed. Like eating microwaved Chef Boyardee out of a coffee mug at 2am.

@Starbucks
. Yes, it's about the coffee, but it's also about the atmosphere, the comfortable chairs, the smiling baristas, that SMELL of coffee beans and pastries. I know your company isn't a coffee shop but we can all learn from them. #ContentChat
