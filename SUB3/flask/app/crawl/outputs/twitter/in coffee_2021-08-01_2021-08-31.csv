Ohayo.

Chugging iced coffee. Buckling up for Canada  vs USA  in women’s wheelchair basketball at 11:30pm ET.

Past the halfway point of the Paralympics and there’s no stopping now. Can’t stop. Won’t stop. Still with me folks? #Paralympics

So! There's a lovely DeLonghi coffee machine where I'm staying that uses the pod. Coffee tastes fine, is hot and makes me feel good.

It turns out I've been putting used coffee pods in the coffee machine for a week and a half without realising it.

But I did today ... and promptly spilled coffee all over my shirt, just like in the old days.

1) Grind 1 Oz of beans & put them in a coffee press.
2) Add 16 ounces of EXACTLY 199° H2O. 
3) Let it steep for five minutes, press, & pour into your favorite cup. Mmmmm.
4) Dump it all in the sink and then drink some real coffee.
