Apparently you can also get rebates for planting a bunch of other tree types, including, per https://caseytrees.org/trees-list/, persimmon!  
...or something called a Kentucky coffeetree, which tbh I'd never heard of before...

Pawpaws are the largest fruit native to North America and are something of a regional celebrity. Their fruit tastes like a cross between a banana and a mango. We plant these for free through our residential planting programs http://caseytrees.org/free
