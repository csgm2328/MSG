I'm catching up with the #doctorsbar incident and #istandwithMeb. Anti trans activists were rightly shown the door for wearing transphobic slogans & distributing transphobic literature. Nobody would tolerate racist slogans & literature & it should be same for transphobia.

I want my kids in school so people don’t think they’re absolute morons when they write. If only your parents would have had the same desire for their children.

What a terrible few days, I just want to say thank you to everyone for all the support, love & kindness over this last few days and indeed this last four months.
The relentless abuse and lies spread about me have been utterly horrific, I can't tell you in words how scared I was
