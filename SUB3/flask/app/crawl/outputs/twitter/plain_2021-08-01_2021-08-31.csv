Nightmare scenario:

Democrats fail to reform or end the filibuster, resulting in them missing this opportunity to revise the Electoral Count Act -- and because of this, a future presidential election does get stolen.

Not only is this demeaning to the vicims, but this is just plain making jokes at the expense of people's traumatic experiences. Fuck you

UTLA President Cecily Myart-Cruz says learning loss is a myth. “It’s OK that our babies may not have learned all their times tables.... They know the difference between a riot and a protest. They know the words insurrection and coup.” https://eiaonline.com/intercepts/2021/08/30/los-angeles-magazine-gives-union-president-the-profile-shes-earned/…

Women's spaces are nothing to do with me but that's your legal right and good for standing up for it. Don't let the GC's get you down.
