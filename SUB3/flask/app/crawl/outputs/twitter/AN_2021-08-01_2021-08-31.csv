I woke up early on the morning of the last day of August.

@jjhorgan

Instead of talking around Gravel Beef, @_amanda_panda_ and Lauren De Crescenzo tackled it head on. Great conversation that’s worth your time. And it’s only on @groadio. https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ptcLikun51cZyYAjOSlvW?si=V94xuYFWTA-AFFlvrycoVg&dl_branch=1…
