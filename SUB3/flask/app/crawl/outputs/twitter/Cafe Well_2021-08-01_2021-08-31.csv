A puff of cognac or a sip of smoke

Say there is nothing to revoke.

A phantom sorrow in his sleeve;

On memories it can't relieve.

I’ve had the slow murmur of a Paris thought, the kind that won’t leave

8월 16일","Two old dears in the cafe next to me:

Old Dear 1: “So our Josie had it really bad and it was after she’d had the two injections”

Old Dear 2: “Oh....? Oh well”.

Consider that’s the attitude of 90% of the Godforsaken population. Pathetic.

@SBWorkersUnited
 just spilled the coffee beans that they have gathered a massive organizing committee.
@Starbucks
, listen to the demands of the workers in Buffalo and sign their Fair Election Principles: a union will improve their cafés, and lives. That's the tea!

Ich lächle und sage: Well, whatever brings you joy, think it!

Denke ich bin wieder bereit für Deutschland.
