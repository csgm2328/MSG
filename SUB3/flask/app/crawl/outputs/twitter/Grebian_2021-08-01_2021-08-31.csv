Slavery existed in:

Egypt
Europe
Africa
North and South America
The Persian Empire
The Muslim Empire 
The Grecian Empire
China 
Mongolia
Japan 

Slavery is not a white phenomenon. No society is guiltless.

These lies are pushed by race hustlers to perpetuate racial grievances.

Los conservadores se espantan porque la Convención discute sobre la República. Seamos honestos: lo que tenemos en Chile todavía se parece bastante más a una Monarquía, con un presidente todopoderoso como lo soñaron Pinochet y Jaime Guzmán. El cambio es hoy.
