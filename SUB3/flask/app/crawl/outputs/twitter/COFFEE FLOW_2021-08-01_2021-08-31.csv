Hope you all have a good one today.

@LanceStorm
 talk it up, I decided to give 
@noowaveco
 Flow State Coffee a try. 
This is one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. Smooth, amazing flavour, and it doesn't tear up my stomach, either. Lives up to all the hype, I think. Will buy again, for sure.
