عائشہ کو مینارِ پاکستان پر صرف چار سو لوگوں نے نہیں نوچا، آج سوشل میڈیا پر اسے ڈراما اور بدکردارکہہ کر ہر درندہ اسے بھنبھوڑ رہا ہے۔ مطلب چار سو کرائے کے لوگوں سے یہ سب کروایا گیا اور ایک بھی حلال زادہ نہیں تھا جو اسے بچاتا۔ اصل میں یہ چار سو لوگ ہم سب ہی تھے، یہ ہمارا ہی چہرہ ہیں

I will also be making obscure allusions to the following poems to see how many the host knows:
Afterwards, Cargoes, The Second Coming, Adlestrop, Autumn, Chapman’s Homer, The Lake Isle of Inisfree, Snow, Churchgoing, and Musee des Beaux Arts. I’ll also quote Polonius if provoked.
