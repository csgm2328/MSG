Mad how Avatar, the highest grossing and most successful movie of all time, has literally no cultural footprint and no ongoing points of reference or debate. There aren’t even any notable quotes or memes. It’s like a billion dollars just appeared and then instantly disappeared.

The Afghan archivists had managed to save 7,000 movies totalling up to 32,000 hours of 16mm film and 8,000 hours of 35mm film. |

Afghan Filmmakers Fear For Their Lives – and for the Safety of the Archives
Some of them had attended preservation workshops in India and were cautiously hopeful about the future.
