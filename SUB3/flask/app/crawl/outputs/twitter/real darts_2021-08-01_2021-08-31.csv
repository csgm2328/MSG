Hanging on my office wall: Al Qaeda fighters imprisoned in northern Afghanistan after the US invasion. One of them smiled as he told me he’d kill Americans. Disturbing to see these prisons now emptied.

8월 19일","In my opinion, it’s impossible to judge the true peaks and depth of a draft class in real time. Maybe can note 3-4-5% differences, but not notable in moment.

2020 was “Weak”, and the top-2 picks are future all-stars. We really are throwing darts.

People be overreacting when they say a ""draft class is weak"". Like yeah it may not be as strong as prior or future classes but the chances of it being as bad as 2000 like some act like it will (2019 and 2016 being big examples of this) is just unrealistic.
