8월 26일","A kilo of robust espresso coffee beans devours around 19,000 liters of water, while making a pair of jeans requires around 10,000 liters. And the grain-fed steak we like to order? One kilo of beef needs 15,000 liters of water. So do the math.
Water scarcity: What's the big deal?
Access to clean drinking water is a human right, but as the global population grows and the planet heats up, can we rely on this resource we take for granted?

8월 28일","Dorian felt like an apocalypse. 

The scent of dead bodies decomposing as the sun rose… my step dad had to find coffee beans for my sister and I smell as we drove through settlements.

Seeing.. dead bodies. 

How can you forget something like that?
