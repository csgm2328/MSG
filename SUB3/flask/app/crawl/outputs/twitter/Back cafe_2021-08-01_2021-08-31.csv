だが、ここで一つの疑惑が。

普通は感染症対策完全無視だと小池に目をつけられてもおかしくないのだが、グローバルダイニングの様に狙い撃ちされた話を聞かないのは、どうも釈然としない。

8월 26일","Elle avait eu la première médaille d’or aux JO, battu Suzanne Lenglen et été reçue par Giscard à l’Elysée, elle fumait des Royales après son café et se foutait de sa postérité, “on va pas en faire un foin.”

Back home au Monde pour Marguerite Broquedis !
Marguerite Broquedis, « déesse » du tennis et première championne olympique française
« Nos oubliées » (4/6). Morte dans l’anonymat en 1983, Marguerite Broquedis fut, avant Suzanne Lenglen, une tenniswoman de renom qui révolutionna son sport.
