8월 11일","My work forced me to leave on the same day I handed my notice in after working professionally for 2 years for them. Walked me out the building like security. My new job the 3 directors always invite me round to the pub and to their house for BBQ’s. treated like family.

Handed in my notice and my manager didn’t even reply, I know she got it because one of the other girls phoned me to ask about me leaving.

Had my first day at my new job today and my new manager is on annual leave, she phoned me anyway to ask how it went.

That’s the difference.
