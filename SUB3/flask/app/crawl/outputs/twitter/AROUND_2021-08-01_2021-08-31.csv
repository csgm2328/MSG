Electric cars have much lower life cycle emissions, new study confirms
In the US, life cycle emissions for EVs are already 60-68% lower than gasoline.

Also: Rossi nearly transferred to Club Brugge in a few weeks ago for around $8-10m, but the deal fell through.

Meanwhile, more than 250 housing units in the city sit empty. @hilaryYXE wants a plan to support people to successfully live in them
