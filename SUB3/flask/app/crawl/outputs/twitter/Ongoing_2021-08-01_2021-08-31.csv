@GovHolcomb
 has extended IN's public health emergency again, thru Sep 30. He's also extended an order on steps like temp licensing of health workers -- but for just 2 days, to Wed, to ""allow for ongoing conversations w/healthcare stakeholders to evaluate pertinent information.""

8월 31일","Macron made many mistakes in the Middle East. Choosing not to indulge the decaying and backwards Islamist movements that were rising across the region isn’t one of them; except, of course, for his courtship of Hezbollah and Iran - that was horrible and is an ongoing mistake.

@EmmanuelMacron so far in the #MiddleEast : 

-Screwed #Libya by inviting Haftar to Paris, elevating him the level of an internationally recognised govt in the name of counter terrorism. 

-Invited Egyptian Pres Sisi to Paris for an award 

-Said Islam was in crisis (it’s not). 1
