And their oxygen saturation drops to… 88%…. 82%….. 78%…. 75%…..

@ECB_cricket
 is totally deaf to the concerns of county members. And many if not most of the counties themselves are utterly supine.  Recipe for disaster.

I feel for county fans who are watching their clubs decimated by the new franchise structure. The heartbeat of cricket lies in the loyalty of its members. I fear plenty of counties will see a rapid decrease in memberships should a compromise not be struck by @ECB_cricket.

 when you really need her? She wouldn’t have Daddy Buffoon on the programme without giving him a hard time but it looks very much like she has been disciplined for lack of impartiality by Tory appeasers within the supine BBC management.

…meanwhile @BBCNewsnight - the BBCs flagship news program - have invited the prime ministers dad - Stanley - on to the program as a “climate expert” to discuss the subject.

Nobody in the rest of the world is listening to this nonsense.
It’s ridiculous.

The worst part of machine learning snake-oil isn't that it's useless or harmful - it's that ML-based statistical conclusions have the veneer of mathematics, the empirical facewash that makes otherwise suspect conclusions seem neutral, factual and scientific.
