Him: ""Hear that helicopter?"".
Me: <listening> ""I don't think that's a helicopter.""
Him: ""CRAP! Flat tire!.""

Luckily there was an exit nearby with a pull-out.
Put on the spare.
PHEW!

Truckies who blockaded the M1 during peak hour claim they are fighting for the freedom of all Australians.

Unlucky commuters trapped in traffic chaos for more than an hour this morning may beg to differ. @meggillespie9 #9News
