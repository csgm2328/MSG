I know this may seem like A LOT, but when so many things are on my to-do list simultaneously, I can spend 10-15 min between each task just deciding what to do next. This helps with my ""now what?"" anxiousness.

“He comes all the way from Mainland Canada to not answer questions. Why is that?” 

Mary Cormier went to the Conservative event because she’s on the fence on who to vote for.

“I wanted to come see Erin in person, and I was very disappointed he didn’t answer the questions.”
