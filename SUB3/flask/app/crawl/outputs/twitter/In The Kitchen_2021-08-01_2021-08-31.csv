The gecko has been found! 

We spent HOURS tearing down every bookshelf, scouting every vent an ohd dark corner...

Little fuck was sleeping in the kitchen like a badass when I woke up this morning. 

I screamed. Like a very happy banshee.

Sorry for the abrupt end to the stream. We had a gecko pull a prison break, and we're trying to find the little criminal and put him back in the slammer.
