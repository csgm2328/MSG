Are they idiots, or do they just think we are??

No.

This morning, I caught a glimpse of the restoration work happening at “Residence A” of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House
- LA’s first @UNESCO World Heritage Site.

After falling into disrepair for many years, I was proud to help provide and secure funding for its restoration.
