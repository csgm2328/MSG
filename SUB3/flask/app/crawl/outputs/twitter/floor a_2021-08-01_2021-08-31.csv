@FraktArt
 minted on $SOL around July 18. Sol as $26. You could mint for .5 Sol, or $13. The floor is now 30 SOL, or $3,300 . . . This is the floor. Out of nowhere the most succesful SOL NFT. A cool 250x on the floors. This should bring tons of attention to SOL NFTs.

Grieving as an adult is hard asf because you still gotta keep going. Even when your life feels like it’s at a standstill, it really don’t stop for nobody.

On a related note, now is the time to scoop this floor as prices are heading up!

An important thread on driving behaviors for #NFT projects...

NFT projects should focus MOST on rewarding ownership and HODLing instead of raising awareness with marketing.

When the roadmap is compelling and HODLing is rewarded, buyers will follow.
