8월 31일","I was a student at Khalsa College Amritsar from 1991-94. Three places I have seen destroyed in the name of renovation/expansion since then:
1. Golden Temple entrance frontage and so-called heritage street leading to it.
2. Joint Check Post Attari.
3. Jallianwala Bagh.

I am literally heartbroken..

Having served as Deputy Commissioner Amritsar from 1992 to 1996, I really understand what emotions the old entrance conveyed.

Are you sure that this picture is genuine? I still can’t believe it! twitter.com/ranjona/status…

This weapon is the AR-15, and is dubbed the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Erin O'Toole has promised he will make it legal again in Canada if he becomes PM, as per his own policy platform and reclassification scheme.
