8월 17일","My wife and I really wanted churros so I picked some up from our favorite spot before the wedding.

At the reception they never got broken into so we brought them to our hotel room.

We ate exactly two each and then forgot them in the mini fridge.

if you're married, would you tell me a small detail from your wedding that you love? 

my friend Bri made pourover coffee for myself and all the groomsmen during our getting ready and it was such a small joy.
