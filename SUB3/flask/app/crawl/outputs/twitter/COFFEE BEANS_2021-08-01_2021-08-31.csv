8월 24일","Me compre un café de Panama en Alemania y no sé que es pero no me gusto el sabor  sera por que es lightly roasted y estoy acostumbrada al sabor de darker ones?

I was pretty excited about it cuz the coffee beans came from Volcán. Maybe I don’t know how to prepare it.

I’ve had the same problem getting my Tibetan Monk green tea bags, vegan rain forest coffee beans and even North Pole glacier Ice cubes. 
Meanwhile Dad is at ski lodge in Switzerland, Mum in Italy, no issues!
