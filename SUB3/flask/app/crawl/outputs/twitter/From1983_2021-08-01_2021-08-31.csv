8월 9일","Watching ""War Games"" from1983, wow, what a world.
No internet, few if any cell phones. Researching at the library using the card catalog and microfiche reader. Dialing up using a MODEM to communicate computer to computer.
The world has changed so much since then. Amazing.",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/Kalifornia4Cruz/status/1424741254919688198
