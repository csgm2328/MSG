8월 28일","I’ve used coffee to build rapport with strangers before. Multiple times actually. Funny enough, fellow caffeine addicts and enthusiasts of the roasted bean juice unite over the simplest cup of Joe.

So let me ask you, do you drink coffee?

8월 26일","A study found you should take pills with water, not coffee, juice or soda. And maybe not milk either. Anything other than water can affect how pills break down in your stomach. If it happens too fast, your body doesn't have enough time to absorb the meds.

One tip to help you optimize health and weight?  

Eliminate wheat bread. 2 slices of wheat bread can spike your blood glucose as much as a 12 ounce can of soda.

Most whole wheat breads & all white breads are high in sugar = inflammation.
