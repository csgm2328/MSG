@CoachLTid
 to be inducted into the HOF. He serves our game daily. He loves the state of TX. He loves impacting young people. He’s generous, thoughtful and an excellent coach. He makes us all better. Congrats my friend! #BIGTIME

Yesterday @CoachLTid called me and @courtnee_locke to come help paint our new lockerroom. As we were working we found out he had become a hall of famer. Most coaches would of quit for the day and go celebrate, instead he celebrated by putting in work to finish the job
