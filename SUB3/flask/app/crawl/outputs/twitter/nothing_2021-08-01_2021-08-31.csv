  What did you do today to help  #FreeNazanin ? Gabriella will be nine years old before Nazanin sees her again if you just sit back and do nothing - 8 birthdays missed. You can’t let this happen.

The memory of Gabriella’s 1st birthday is all the family crowded into our front room,her flushed cheeks and confused smiles,her parents proud & thankful she had grown so big.

Her second birthday was full of shock. #FreeNazanin taken captive.
Gabi is 7yo still without her mother

how come we have Bundesliga games with 20k audience, ManU plays in front of 72k people, but no crowds for Worlds??

just like with football, esports is nothing without the fans and the thought of an empty #Worlds2021 venue makes me so uninterested in the event
