a  grin  and  nod,  full  understanding  of  the  willingness  to  try  anything  to  do  with  coffee  at  least  once.  (  they  should  probably  both  try  * sleeping  for  once, instead.  )

    it was great to see someone else enjoying being with the dogs almost as much as will did. 

“yes,” was his reply. “they are. some i’ve adopted, some that have shown up themselves.”

Clint chuckles against the rim of his cup.

   “You’re the only reason I ever get through these meetings,” he says after a sip, raises the half-eaten donut to her in salutation. “Gotta give credit where credit’s due — you’re a lifesaver. I mean it.” twitter.com/TREMORIBUS/sta…

a chuckle escapes her lips, nodding at him before crossing her arms across her chest. 

“ wow— and you beat up all twenty of them up by yourself? that's pretty impressive, ” she teases, sarcasm obvious in her tone. twitter.com/greenshiftings…
