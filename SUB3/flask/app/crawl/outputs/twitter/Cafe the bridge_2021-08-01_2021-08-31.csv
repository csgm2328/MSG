 Did you know that it is the oldest bridge in the United Kingdom which still has buildings on it - dating all the way back to 1160AD?

Hilltop Cafe was what I meant, wasn’t it owned by a musician played for Stealers Wheel?

I was eating there once and saw LadyBird Johnson as she left

Bluebonnet Cafe is over by the dam if I recall correctly
