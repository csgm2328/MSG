-전공에 대한 열의와 학습
-다양한 사람들과의 교류
-아르바이트와 여행다니기
(물론 안하는건 아님)

실제로 하고있는 것
-교수님 성대모사(개잘함)
-인류애 박살나는 조별과제
-본인 수업만 듣는 줄 아는 교수님들이 내주는 과제폭탄 해결

Behind Hollywood glamour, an Instagram account highlights darker side for workers
Crew members are pushing producers to give them more rest periods to address persistent complaints that they are working dangerously long hours to meet production schedules.
