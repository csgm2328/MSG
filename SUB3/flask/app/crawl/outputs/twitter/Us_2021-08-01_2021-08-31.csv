8월 31일","Han sido 5 horas pegado a la pantalla, pero hemos presenciado un partido que seguro recordaremos todo este US Open.

Así os he contado el PARTIDAZO entre Tsitsipas y Murray. Almíbar puro!!
Tsitsipas se lleva ante Murray un partido que será difícil olvidar
PARTIDAZO el que hemos vivido en la Arthur Ashe. El griego necesitó de casi cinco horas para superar a un renacido Andy Murray.
