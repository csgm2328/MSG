it’s funny when you look at yuzuru hanyu’s 3A and think about the fact that he first tried 3A because he saw a fellow skater do it and thought it looked “easy”. he proceeded to land it on his second attempt or so. goat things!

8월 28일","There's a decent chance that Marwin makes the postseason roster. Typically makes sense to go 13 hitters due to off days.

Assuming health, you'll have your 9 regular starters + Diaz, Meyers, Castro. 

For 13, Jones is a better ""bat"" than Marwin, but far less defensive versatility

8월 28일","I think K-pop fans & analysts in S. Korea tend to overestimate K-pop or pop music's worth in general in the context of exports.

It makes sense when music is more mainstream than video games, a better fit for national pride. But it doesn't make as much money, if not far less.

People in the K-pop bubble definitely think it matters more than it does, generally. Not excluding myself from that at times. twitter.com/hyunsuinseoul/…

Our trans community are having a difficult time here.

I went to Pakistan to deliver a workshop on PTSD & unexpectedly was invited to speak to the trans community in Lahore

They have a lot of work to do, but there's more acceptance of trans community there- @saiqa_naz
