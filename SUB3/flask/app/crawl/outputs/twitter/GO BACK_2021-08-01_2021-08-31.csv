Dublin City Council will soon end its trial pedestrianisation of Capel St/Parliament St and are now looking for the public’s input. Did you like it? Think it should be permanent? Made 24/7 not just weekend nights?
Please let them know what you think here:

Steve’s entire ethos as a character is to be selfless (so much so it makes him a hypocrite in Infinity War), so learning at the end of Endgame, “hey, maybe I can leave the fight behind & enjoy the quiet life I never got” is his arc.

For me it’s not me wanting him to “stay with Bucky”

It’s him yeeting his entire character growth to go back in time and simp for Peggy.
