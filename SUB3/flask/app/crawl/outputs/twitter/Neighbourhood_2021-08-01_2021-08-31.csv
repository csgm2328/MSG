Sending

 all the love, support, and solidarity in the face of this ongoing harassment. As a community we must do better to condemn all acts of violence, not only on the campaign trail but in every neighbourhood—every single day.

Hi, folks. This post is really important. It concerns very serious acts of harassment that have been aimed at our campaign, and at me personally. Please, please, please take the time to read Shaye's words. twitter.com/shayeACmurray/…

Wow, what a great turn out at Rouge Urban National Park for Casting with Cops! 

Everyone was provided bait, a rod and were able to learn and have some great laughs with the officers. Many youth caught their first fish ever! (1/2)
