We recently received board approval to purchase over $500M of crypto on our balance sheet to add to our existing holdings. And we'll be investing 10% of all profit going forward in crypto. I expect this percentage to keep growing over time as the cryptoeconomy matures.

Yep, Kilt is legit AF. Found out there are kilt nodes running on smart meters in Germany. I know what they're up to with the German federal energy agency. 

Also have the ex-CMO and current CFO of Polkadot on their team :)
