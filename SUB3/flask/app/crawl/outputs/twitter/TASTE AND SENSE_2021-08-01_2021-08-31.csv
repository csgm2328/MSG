- you get the sense if you weren’t dressed “right” they wouldn’t talk to you 
- they affect how much they LOVE ART without having true taste 
- they haven’t read a single book but are all about books

Sacred. Glorious. Powerful.

Preaching today? Me too. Let's remember: They don't need eloquence. They need the tincture of Jesus himself.
