He is a disgrace and not fit to hold the office of the President of the United State.

Joe Maddon said they’re getting closer to considering shutting him down this season, but they’ll take cues from Trout in how to handle that.

He said the team is “getting closer” to having to decide whether it’s time to shut him down. They could have that talk in the next week or two. They’ll continue to communicate with him on what they want to do

There are still thousands of AMERICANS abandoned by Joe Biden, who are now hostages at the mercy of the Taliban and Isis.
