I have no idea why I feel like this is poverty porn? Why perform in a dumpsite without anyone present to listen to the music? Who paid for it and what do they do with the footage? 
Bro. I love you and everything you've done I your careers but I have many questions. twitter.com/JulianiKenya/s…

 no matter how much you try to will “endemic” from Pandemic, in your “living with COVID” mantras, the case numbers in SK & The World do not lie.
