And lest I forget, a steaming hot cup of coffee.

at least trying to
skystage still curtained
rainclouds

a hopeful bird chirps
g'morning
he should get his worms
before it pours again

my coffee and I wait
for the strange new
papaya-eating woodpecker
youngster

smiling
lost in your voice from night

Sounds simple enough, but how do you define the word sandwich?

So I can’t lease to coffee shops who sell avocado toast? What about bagel shops - does a bagel sandwich count 

No deal.
