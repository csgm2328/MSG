Those passes haven't been as effective in red zone situational work, but there have been moments. And tight ends again look great.

2. It felt like Russ was purposefully focusing on getting the short game and quick passes going. Hooks. Slants. Plays to the flats. Quick seams in the red zone. He didn't chuck it deep much outside of an awesome deep ball to Lockett with a diving catch early & a trick play.

On that day, 100 prisoners were massacred in honour of the visiting SS's Reichsführer.

Il #15agosto 1941 nel campo di #Shirokaya (#Minsk), le #Einsatzgruppen massacrarono 100 prigionieri in onore di #Himmler in visita al campo.
E' probabile tra i morti ci fu anche il soldato che, dimostrando una tempra senza pari, sfidò #Himmler e le #SS tenendo alto lo sguardo.

The United States ranks 25th in the Democracy Index of the British Economist as ""incomplete democracy"".
