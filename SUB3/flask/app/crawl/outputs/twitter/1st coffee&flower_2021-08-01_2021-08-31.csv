I get we're thin at RB, and saving them for the Big 12 is most important, but we gotta get the Perine/Mixon run shares going.

This is not cause I dislike Spencer, this is how Oklahoma was the dominant offense in 2015-2018.

1st, by criminalising marriages prior to prescribed age but after puberty, govts are making criminals out of people & ruining their lives.
2nd, if marriage before certain age is criminal then it should apply to all humans. Why exempt a religion when criminal law is common to all?

2nd: Bots, and Associates that you prefer not to associate with, but tolerate or hope to assoiate with.
3rd: They are all either managed accounts or bots.
