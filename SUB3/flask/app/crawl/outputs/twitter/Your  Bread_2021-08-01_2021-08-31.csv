IPOB need to revisit their strategy. If u have your pple in strategic positions in the govt, or the Gov is IPOB. Can an IG have the audacity to kill your people on your LAND?

@twitter
 and deal with this. Sophie posts a picture of challah - a bread we eat on the sabbath - and is told ‘go away Jews’. And look at all the other antisemitic posts. They go on and on. Please do something.

Let's hope the @Twitter reporting system works to evict this antisemite from the platform, who commented ""go away Jews"" on my tweet, then much worse elsewhere (see second screenshot). Please help to stop abuse by reporting them too.

8월 28일"," I'm like you driver, there must be an exchange
 You ordered a lot
 Just a cup of coffee, and a bit more
 Think carefully
 Just a bread
 Grilled pork and rice, when I was at your home
 I paid for it
 We switched!

8월 31일","Some Baton Rouge supply updates:
-the target on Siegen is open but I’m told there’s no refrigeration.
-the Trader Joe’s is fully open and stocked. It looks like they replenished everything they were running low on like bread.

Be good to one another, check on your neighbors.
