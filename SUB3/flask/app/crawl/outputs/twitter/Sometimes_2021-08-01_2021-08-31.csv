Many people know this already, but it bears repeating. Abuse is not always obvious. Abuse is not always overt physical or sexual violence. Abuse can be (and often is) insidious, hidden, and disguised with charm, charisma, and claims of love. It's about control and power.

If you’re watching white supremacists target Prime Minister Trudeau & thinking “this isn’t Canada,” remember how BIPOC are targeted by the police. Places of worship are vandalized. Leaders don't acknowledge systemic racism.

White supremacy is as Canadian as poutine & hockey.
