We’re all in the same storm but not in the same boat

When we asked the ultra-rich to pay their fair share, Mr. Trudeau teamed up with Mr. O’Toole to vote no, and your family pays the price.

I'll close tax loopholes, crack down on tax evasion and shut down tax havens. #Elxn44

For the dedicated FKJ JS1 funds, here's what we have collected as of today. As we are one step closer to JS1 as well as Snowdrop, please expect more fundraising activities so we can gather more funds to support Jisoo!

We kinda call them ""Maverick"" developers. Someone who'll go off and work on a feature that's out of scope, and then bring it to the table to try and get people to buy in without it going through the regular ratification process.

The thing about “passionate” devs “choosing” to crunch is that they make extra work for other departments, too. This establishes a martyr mentality that can be toxic to team collaboration and communication. Let me explain…
